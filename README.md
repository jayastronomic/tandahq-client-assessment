# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get the client running, it is suggested to start the backend configuration and spin the server.
Here is the link for the backend repo https://github.com/jayastronomic/tandahq-server-assessment.

Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 6 on your machine to use React.

Cors is already set up for the client and backend to communicate through HTTP request.
After cloning this repository, and installing it on your local machine, the only command you need to get the client configured is:

```
npm install
```

Running this command will install all of the dependicies needed for the client to run.

This project was designed with tailwindcss, which is a great framework to build custom UI components fast and effeciently.

To start the client server, run the command:

```
npm start
```

After that, the client will run on your local machine connected to Port 3000.
Make sure any ports on Port 3000 are closed to run the app.
